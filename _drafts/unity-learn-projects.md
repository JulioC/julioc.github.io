A journal with highlights from projects available on [Unity Learn](http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules).

### [Roll-a-Ball](http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-a-ball)

This is the most basic tutorial, presenting the basic tools on the engine: the Editor (navigation, hierarchy, prefabs), simple 3D objects (cubes and spheres), Components (basic physics), scripting, GUI (it still uses the old components) and publishing. The video is a screen cap with the tutor's voice.

Since it's just an introductory material, it's OK, but calls for an updated version.
