### Ludum Dare

[Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/) is an online competition where developers are challenged to create a game from zero in 48 hours, based on a theme defined by voting. After that, the games are rated by the developers on several aspects. I believe it's one of the more traditional game jams, ocurring each four months, since 2002.

I went for the Jam category, it's a more relaxed version of Ludum Dare where developers can form teams and use external assets and code. I was alone, but I could use the great [assets from Kenney](http://kenney.nl/assets), developing the game with Unity.

The theme announced was "An Unconventional Weapon". After some brainstorming, considering from "birds that poo on people" to "destroying aliens with bad music ([Mars Attack!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSbigjiKLoU))", I decided to go with __"using love/cuteness to make bad thing become good things"__.

The plan was to create a platformer where you wouldn't be able to avoid enemies, but would throw hearts at them, transforming into friendly elements. The levels would be random, with progressive size and number of enemies. The player would be an alien that would help sad planets to become happier, so I wanted to make the levels a curved to look like a small planet and include "space travel" as level transitions.

Sadly not everything I dreamed was possible for me at the time, specially considering that I had some scheduling issues and worked just about 16 hours on the game. You can __[play Sad Planets at itch.io](http://julioc.itch.io/sad-planets-jam?secret=yB5pzukxhSxx3RdqXg1rXd2q4o)__ to check it by yourself.

#### What went wrong

When you play the game something that you will notice is how the levels are not well balanced and sometimes you'll get stuck on invisible objects. I believe both issues are related to the random level generation I created. It would be much better if more time was dedicated to tweaking it.

On the end, I wasn't able to pay enough attention to the game UI, leaving out my concept of level transitions. The idea of curved levels wasn't even considered for me during the development, it would take too much time for little difference on the game.

I started using the camera script from Unity Standard Assets, a bad choice since it wasn't suited for the game. The mood of the game is other thing that was really poor, and it could be improved a lot with some audio effects and a better background and environment.

After all, I still believe my worst failure was to not plan for my Ludum Dare weekend, implying in have insufficient time for the game.

#### What was right

Even if the level generation brought some problems to the game, it was a nice feature, since I could spend just some time building the modules that would be used on the process, leaving my time for other aspects of the game.

I am happy with my theme interpretation, it's something that I had never seen before and could be explored in lot of ways. Using the assets from kenney helped a lot too, since they make a great first impression to the game.

Above all, using this opportunity to publish the game was great. I got a lot of feedback from the other developers, bringing my attention to points that I hadn't noted before (like the camera and music issues).

### Kolks Games Jam

The guys from [Kolks Games](http://www.kolksgames.com.br/) (a brazilian website with resources for game developers) organized their first game Jam on the last weekend. It was an online event, with duration of 48 hours and no limitations on the use of external assets.

Even if I had already used the previous weekend for Ludum Dare, I would try to make something for it. The theme was "water" (_água_ in portuguese), which was nice, because I wanted to create a game like [Pipe Mania](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_Mania) at some point.

My game this time was not great, mostly because I spent about 8 hours on it. Once again, I used sprites made by kenney and Unity. It's called [Água Mania](http://julioc.itch.io/agua-mania-jam?secret=pArzTs3Jxmtcr8iDJwmJi0freM), and it's also [available on itch.io](http://julioc.itch.io/agua-mania-jam?secret=pArzTs3Jxmtcr8iDJwmJi0freM).

Sadly I feel the game ended up being too rushed and incomplete. I'll surely make a proper rework on Pipe Mania/Água Mania at some point.
