## Diving into C# with Unity

An overview on my learning process of C# while starting out with Unity development

### The enviroment

I can't deny, the built in editor, [MonoDevelop](http://www.monodevelop.com/) is a nice IDE, with all the features I expected from it, including code completion, error detection and debug integration with Unity. Sadly, it's not as stable as I expected and has some bugs that make it unusable on my machine (it doesn't handle quotes from my keyboard).

An alternative was to use Visual Studio, which has a nice integration using [Visual Studio Tools for Unity](http://unityvs.com/). Like MonoDevelop, it's possible to debug Unity scripts on Visual Studio. The only issue I have is that it doesn't work with the Express version (correct me if I'm wrong).

My next plan was to go with my usual editor, [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/). I'd heard about [OmniSharp](https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-sublime), a plugin for Sublime which adds IDE features such as error reporting and IntelliSense-like code completion (below). On [this post by Jonathan Channon](http://blog.jonathanchannon.com/2014/11/12/csharp-first-class-citizen-sublime-text/), where the image comes from, you can get an overview on the plugin installation and some other nice animations of the features OmniSharp has.
