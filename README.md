# JulioC

My [personal website](http://julioc.me/) hosted on GitHub Pages.

## TODO List

* __Portfolio__: eventually I want be able to have a list of my projects, much like the [projects.html](projects.html) file, but dynamicly loaded, maybe with [Jekyll collections](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/)
* __Syntax highlight__: Remove highlight.js in favor of rouge ~~if~~ when GH Pages updates
* __Localization__: Find out a better way to handle localization of the resume

## Acknowledges

* Thanks for [@barryclark](https://github.com/barryclark) (author of [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now)) and [@mdo](https://github.com/mdo) (author of [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole)) for providing structured samples of Jekyll usage and random code snippets
* [@juthilo](https://github.com/juthilo) for creating the [tutorial on how to get Jekyll working on Windows](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/)
* The [resume page](_includes/resume.html) is based on [JSON Resume](http://jsonresume.org/) project, following their JSON schema (at least I hope so)
* This page also uses [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [jQuery](http://jquery.org/), [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/), [Font-Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com) (really!) and other stuff if we go deeper and deeper in the dependency tree
